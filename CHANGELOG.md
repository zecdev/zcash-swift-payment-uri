# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased 
This release contains several **API breaking changes**, but let not be discouraged to
update! These changes are made to add several checks to the library to ensure that your payment
requests stick to the ZIP-320 specification.
### Added
- Create `ParserContext` enum which enables definitions that are network-dependent 
- Create `AddressValidator` Protocol to define address validators.
- Add `ParserContext` to RecipientAddress initializer and to parser methods that are
context-aware

### Changed
- `PaymentRequest` individual payments are checked to ensure they all belong to the same network.
Network is determined by the HRP of the addresses.
- HRPs of `RecipientAddress` are verified to determine whether they could belong to a certain network 
and/or Zcash pool.
- **Important:** Formal verification still must be provided by callers. The checks included by 
``AddressValidator`` default implementation does not check Bech32 validity. 
- `Payment` has `Amount?` to represent payment requests with undefined amount by the request author.

## [0.1.0-beta.9] - 2024-09-03

- [#64] maintain iOS 15 compatibility
    
    Lukas Korba from ECC reported that Zashi couldn't be built since
    the latest version of BigDecimal depend on BigInt which has min
    deployment target of iOS 16.4. We temporarily locked this dependency
    until we could figure out a long term change.
